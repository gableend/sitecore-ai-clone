Transitioning to a composable architecture has also streamlined feature development, simplified content and catalog management, and cut content release times from nearly an hour to just 7 minutes. Managing global ecommerce products and pricing with multiple currency types, inventory counts, catalogs and more has also been streamlined. The platform\u2019s flexibility and scalability allows JMM to seamlessly intregrate third-party services and new tools with low-code changes, adapting to new business needs.

Featuring simplified navigation, personalization, 90% fewer site pages, and enhanced search capabilities, the new platform significantly improves the user experience, making it easier for users to find the content they need. Within the first two days of launch, the new websites drew 2,500 unique visitors with only five service desk incidents reported. NMDP is now the number one site for \u2018bone marrow donation\u2019 searches, and the organization has experienced an increase of 132% in searches for \u2018NMDP volunteer\u2019. The benefits extend beyond website users. NMDP has also enhanced productivity and satisfaction for its developers, marketers, and content creators by optimizing operations. \u201cThanks to Sitecore, we\u2019ve unified processes and made life simpler, enabling the web team to focus on delivering more advanced capabilities rather than spending hours updating content,\u201d commented Arendt. Previously, the organization frequently relied on external agencies to deliver projects and campaigns. Empowered by Sitecore, NMDP can now handle these tasks internally. Marketers can independently create campaigns, develop content, and implement personalization strategies. Sitecore continues to underpin NMDP\u2019s digital transformation. "

The company has also enhanced accessibility for increased inclusivity, updated copy to streamline customer journeys, and made it easier for users to book a table. With Sitecore, the company can better understand customer behavior and conduct testing to enable continuous improvement. For example, the digital team identified that by increasing the prominence of the book button, it was able to enhance click-through to book by 23%.

In December 2023, Unbound introduced a new feature powered by Sitecore XP that allows supporters to explore its \u2018Agents of Change\u2019 proposals and directly fund initiatives they are passionate about. These proposals represent small, local projects with the potential to create meaningful community transformation. Using Sitecore, Unbound delivers dynamic content tailored to website users and can update it rapidly. This capability is crucial since 90% of the sponsor experience now occurs online. Sponsors can access video messages from sponsored families and receive regular updates that deepen engagement. The platform also personalizes content. For example, users interested in education will see information about the scholarship program, while those drawn to community development are presented with details on Agents of Change projects. During emergencies, such as natural disasters, Unbound can swiftly create and launch campaigns to raise funds for those in need. Unbound continues to invest in a digital-first approach. In 2024, it introduced a QR code for its appeals process, enabling digital sign-ups, and added a Zendesk-powered chatbot to its website.
